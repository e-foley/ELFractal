Come along with me<br/>
To a place beside the sea<br/>
We can wander through the forest<br/>
And do so as we please<br/>
<br/>
Come along with me<br/>
To a cliff under a tree<br/>
Where we can gaze upon the water<br/>
As an everlasting dream<br/>
<br/>
All of my affections<br/>
I give them all to you<br/>
Maybe by next summer<br/>
We won't have changed our tune<br/>
<br/>
I still want to be<br/>
In this place beside the sea<br/>
Making up new numbers<br/>
And living so merrily<br/>
<br/>
All of my affections<br/>
I give them all to you<br/>
I'll be here for you always<br/>
And always be for you<br/>
<br/>
Come along with me<br/>
To a place beside the sea<br/>
We can wander through the forest<br/>
And do so as we please<br/>
Living so merrily

Come along with me<br/>
To a town beside the sea<br/>
We can wander through the forest<br/>
And do so as we please<br/>
<br/>
Come along with me<br/>
To a cliff under a tree<br/>
Where we'll gaze upon the water<br/>
As an everlasting dream<br/>
<br/>
All of my affections<br/>
I give them all to you<br/>
Maybe by next summer<br/>
We won't have changed our tune<br/>

I still want to be<br/>
In this town beside the sea<br/>
Making up new numbers<br/>
And living so merrily<br/>

All of my affections<br/>
I give them all to you<br/>
I'll be here for you always<br/>
And always be for you<br/>

Come along with me<br/>
And the butterflies and bees<br/>
We can wander through the forest<br/>
And do so as we please<br/>
<br/>
Come along with me<br/>
To a cliff under a tree<br/>
Where we can gaze upon the water<br/>
As an everlasting dream<br/>
<br/>
All of my collections<br/>
I'll share them all with you<br/>
Maybe by next summer<br/>
We won't have changed our tune<br/>
<br/>
We'll still want to be<br/>
With the butterflies and bees<br/>
Making up new numbers<br/>
And living so merrily<br/>
<br/>
All of my collections<br/>
I'll share them all with you<br/>
I'll be here for you always<br/>
And always be with you<br/>
<br/>
Come along with me<br/>
And the butterflies and bees<br/>
We can wander through the forest<br/>
And do so as we please<br/>
Living so merrily
